      question: "Which of the following would be classified as an \"unsafe condition\" requiring repair or replacement?",
      options: [

        "Normal wear on window seals in a 20-year-old home",
        "Loose cabinet hinges inside a kitchen"
      ],
      answer: 1,
      explanation: "Section 304.1.1 identifies exterior walls that are not properly anchored, not plumb, or show signs of holes, cracks, or rot as unsafe conditions requiring correction in accordance with IBC or IEBC standards."

      id: 106,
      question: "Which of the following best demonstrates a violation of the weather resistance or water tightness requirement?",
      options: [
        "Deteriorating attic insulation",
        "Gutter system not connected to downspouts",
        "Masonry joints not sealed around windows and doors",
        "Paint peeling on an exterior wall with no water intrusion"
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation: "Section 304.1.1 item #4 specifically includes siding and masonry joints between the building envelope and openings that are not weather-resistant or water tight as unsafe."

      id: 107,
      question: "Which of these scenarios would not be classified as an unsafe structural condition?",
      options: [
        "Roofing surface with defects that admit rain",
        "Foundation showing open cracks and poor anchorage",
        "Floor-to-wall anchorage that meets nominal load resistance",
        "Roof framing with signs of fatigue and no proper anchorage"
      ],
      answer: 2,
      explanation: "If the anchorage meets the requirement of resisting all nominal loads or load effects, it does not meet the unsafe threshold as defined under Section 304.1.1 items #1 and #2."

      id: 108,
      question: "Which of the following best describes a structural member that has ‚Äúreached its limit state‚Äù?",

        "A door that sticks due to foundation settling",
        "A beam that visibly sags and shows signs of cracking under normal load",
        "A decorative column not bearing load"

      answer: 2,
      explanation: "Structural components that can no longer support design loads or show failure signs are considered to have reached their ‚Äúlimit state‚Äù and fall under item #3 of Section 304.1.1, requiring correction."
