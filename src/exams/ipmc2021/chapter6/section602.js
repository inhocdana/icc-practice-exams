      question: "A landlord in a region where the average monthly outdoor temperature is 45° (7°C) during the heating season claims that they are only required to maintain 65°F inside habitable rooms of their rental property. Which of the following best explains whether this claim aligns with the code requirements?",
      options: [
        "The landlord is incorrect",
        "The landlord is correct",
        "The landlord is only correct if the heating system cannot maintain 68°F due to outdoor temperatures below design thresholds",

      answer: 1,
      explanation: "According to IPMC Section 602.3, Exception #2, if the average monthly temperature is above 30°F (-1°C), a reduced indoor minimum of 65°F (18°C) is permitted instead of the standard 68°F."
